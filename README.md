 - Utilizes ChartJS library to display financial data in the form of pie-chart offering a visual representation of the user's financial breakdown.
 - Dashboard provides a quick and detailed snapshot of the user's recent financial activity. Data other than the current month are neglected to keep the view relevant, however, data older than a month are available within the annual expense section(refer last point).
 - Dashboard data can be grouped based on the description of the transaction made and can be filtered by nature of the transaction made(Expense/Income).
 - Allows full control over the current month's financial data. Add, Edit or Remove data from the dashboard whenever necessary 
 - Supports recurring expenses(like mobile bills, electricity bills) and implemented logic to remind about the same to avoid missing due dates.

## Note
No need to setup a server as for now.  But backend processes are still undergoing and I hope that the data could be stored in the database soon.
